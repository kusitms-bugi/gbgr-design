# AGENTS.md - packages/react

## Scope
- This file applies to everything under `packages/react`.

## Goal
- Maintain production React components built on `@gbgr/react-headless` and shared icons.

## Preferred Workflow
1. Keep component API and exported paths stable.
2. Run `pnpm --filter @gbgr/react build` after component or export changes.
3. Run `pnpm --filter @gbgr/react typecheck` before finalizing.
4. Confirm CSS export files referenced in `package.json` still exist.

## Guardrails
- Do not bypass headless primitives in ways that duplicate interaction logic unnecessarily.
- Avoid breaking changes to public component props without clear migration intent.
- Keep `dist/` generated by build; do not hand-edit.

## Deploy
1. Component API or export changes require a changeset: `pnpm changeset`.
2. Build and typecheck must pass before release (`pnpm --filter @gbgr/react build` and `typecheck`).
3. Coordinate breaking API changes with docs updates in the same release cycle.

## Testing
1. Run `pnpm --filter @gbgr/react typecheck` and `pnpm --filter @gbgr/react build` for every component change.
2. If component behavior changes, add or update tests when test infrastructure is available.
3. If no automated tests are available for the changed component, record a manual interaction checklist in PR.
4. Write `describe` and `it` test descriptions in Korean.

## Quick Commands
- Build: `pnpm --filter @gbgr/react build`
- Typecheck: `pnpm --filter @gbgr/react typecheck`
